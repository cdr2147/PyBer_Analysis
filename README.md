# PyBer_Analysis
## Project Overview
PyBer, a rideshare company, has asked for visualizations of all rideshare data from January to May 2019 to help with plans to improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. 
### Purpose
After analyzing all data, it is requested that a new analysis be done to create a summary of the ride-sharing data by city type and to produce a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Along with a summary of findings and how the data differs by city type, PyBer will use the results to make decisions about their services given existing differences.  
## Resources
